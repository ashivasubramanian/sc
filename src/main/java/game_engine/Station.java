/**
 * The <code>Station</code> class represents a station on the section. Any station
 * contains tracks, points and signals, which lie under the station's control.
 * The <code>Station</code> class reflects this real world behaviour, by containing
 * separate collections for tracks, points and signals. It also contains setter and
 * getter methods to these collections.<p>
 * A <code>Station</code> instance must contain two aspects, one for each direction
 * beyond the station. Also, it is necessary for that instance to have no more than
 * three tracks. Note that this does not mean that every station must contain three
 * tracks; it only implies that no more than three tracks are to be present in a
 * station.<p>
 * Why is this condition present? That is because when the game was first designed,
 * it was designed only for the Calicut - Shoranur section, which fits the above
 * conditions.
